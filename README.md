## April 2022

- OK time to get this journey going for real. Both of my kids will have graduated college by the end of May 2022. There is no real reason to stay at Saint Leo University any longer. I will be working to get my skills up to par for a full-time coding / web development job so I can quit SLU on last day of the year. They say those that can't do, TEACH. Let's see if I can turn that around and say those that teach, can ALSO do... Time to move on from my time as a manager in Higher Education and Computer Programming Adjunct to full-time developer.

### Week 1:

- It is April 3rd, 2022 and I will use this week to get all of my equipment, websites, and supplies ready to go with everything I may need to accomplish all the things I want to do over the next 6 months. Full disclosure, as an adjunct at a higher institution, I have had to have some formal education. So I may be starting a little ahead of some people that are transitioning from a different career field with no prior programming experience. You can see my education accomplishments above.

### Week 2:

- April 10th - Started ZTM_Python Bootcamp from ZTM_Academy learning Python Basics using Python 3.10 and the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains. I also have VS Code set-up to handle Python and Web Development as a more lighter weight solution to coding as needed.
