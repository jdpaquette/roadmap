## April 2022

- OK time to get this journey going for real. Both of my kids will have graduated college by the end of May 2022. There is no real reason to stay at Saint Leo University any longer. I will be working to get my skills up to par for a full-time coding / web development job so I can quit SLU on last day of the year. They say those that can't do, TEACH. Let's see if I can turn that around and say those that teach, can ALSO do... Time to move on from my time as a manager in Higher Education and Computer Programming Adjunct to full-time developer.

### Week 1:

- It is April 3rd, 2022 and I will use this week to get all of my equipment, websites, and supplies ready to go with everything I may need to accomplish all the things I want to do over the next 6 months. Full disclosure, as an adjunct at a higher institution, I have had to have some formal education. So I may be starting a little ahead of some people that are transitioning from a different career field with no prior programming experience. You can see my education accomplishments above.

### Week 2:

- April 10th - Started ZTM_Python Bootcamp from ZTM_Academy learning Python Basics using Python 3.10 and the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains. I also have VS Code set-up to handle Python and Web Development as a more lighter weight solution to coding as needed.

- Also started the the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp from Dr. Angela Yu. I have a few of her courses and I am looking forward to completing them in conjunction with the ZTM Academy courses along the way. ie. Python to Python then Web Dev to Web Dev. This will give me exposure to two different teaching styles as well as completing different types of projects. --- update (Apr 20th) I stuck with Yu Python and completed all seven days worth of Python code by Sunday and as of today, I am on day 10. Had some fun with text based game / rock, paper, scissors, and hangman. Also created a random password generator and a caesar chipher encryption / decryption program.

- I am also try to add some math courses along the way. I am thinking about Trig / Calc 1 - 3 / and Discrete Math and possibly Statistics. It may be helpful to have the math background when it comes to data structures and algorithms. I will see how it goes and if that is something worthwhile to put some of my time into. ---- update (Apr 20) did not do ANY math last week except in Python.

### Week 3:

- I have been enjoying Angela Yu Python and so far this week I am up to day 10 (Wednesday). I am finding a little issues with updating lists and dictionaries and when to use a for loop vs a while loop. Also -- in for / while loops, do we normally work in the negative??? Why "while not ..." instead of "while ...". It seems like Angela likes the negative version better i.e. "False". Maybe I am missing something that I will better understand while gaining more programming experience with Python and others.

- I started Odin Project this week. Not sure if I should work Web Dev (ZTM / Angela / Odin) simultaneously with Python or complete more Python quickly. I will see what sits better with me as I go along. Mostly just trying to "Program Every Day" -- even if I am tired or busy, I try to get at least a solid hour in per day and usually more.

- Losing some focus. Having a hard time staying motivated this week. Need to try and focus on the end goal to gain a sense of purpose. So many different things I want to do and I keep going on different rabbit holes. Need to try and stick with one think and stay on topic.

### Week 4:
